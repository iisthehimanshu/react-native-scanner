# Changelog

## Unreleased

* New `accel` stream: the raw accelerometer, gravity included, for the page's
  step detector. Samples are in Android's convention (m/s², ~+9.8 on the axis
  pointing up at rest); iOS readings are converted to match. It samples at
  25Hz by default (`accelIntervalMs`) and batches every 100ms
  (`accelFlushIntervalMs`). On Android the batch window is also the sensor's
  report latency, and samples that arrive faster than the configured rate are
  dropped — devices treat the rate as a hint and can deliver several times
  more.
* The bridge bootstrap now lists its streams in `window.__iwayplusScanner.streams`.
  The page reads it before asking for `accel`, so a host built before this
  release is never asked for a stream it cannot run, and the page falls back
  to `devicemotion` there.
* `adapter` state reports `scanning.accel`.
* Android: when GPS delivers no good fix for 5 seconds (`gpsNoFixTimeoutMs`)
  — what being indoors looks like now that the network provider is gone — GPS
  updates are requested every 5 seconds (`gpsBackoffIntervalMs`) instead of
  every `gpsIntervalMs`. A fix worse than 20 m (`gpsGoodAccuracyM`), or with no
  accuracy, backs off at once. Only a good fix restores `gpsIntervalMs`. Every
  fix is still forwarded.
  GPS is never switched off. iOS is unchanged: it has no update interval, and
  Core Location keeps delivering Wi-Fi-assisted fixes indoors.
* New `gpsStatus` event (Android): `{backedOff, intervalMs, reason, timestamp}`,
  emitted when GPS starts and on every backoff or recovery, so the switch is
  visible without waiting for a fix.
* iOS: `CoreMotion` is added to the linked frameworks.
* Android 13+: BLE advertisements are filtered to IwayPlus beacons by a
  hardware `ScanFilter` on the advertised-name prefix (`IW`,
  case-insensitive), so other advertisers never reach the app. The name check
  in the scan callback is removed. Below Android 13, where `ScanFilter` cannot
  match a prefix, scanning is unfiltered and every advertiser is relayed.

## 0.2.1

* Heading now samples at `SENSOR_DELAY_UI` (~16.7Hz) instead of
  `SENSOR_DELAY_GAME` (50Hz). A walking user's heading does not change fast
  enough to need 50 samples a second, and each one cost a sensor wakeup plus
  a matrix remap before the angular filter could discard it. The filter stays:
  the delay is a hint the platform may exceed.
* GPS is GNSS only. The Android network provider is no longer registered —
  it derives a fix from cell towers and Wi-Fi, so indoors it reports the
  building rather than the user, and beacons are the authority once inside.
  `powerState` and the start guard now report on the GPS provider alone, so a
  caller is told the provider is unavailable rather than being started against
  one that delivers nothing.
* No change on iOS for either: Core Location owns the heading rate, and has no
  provider split to remove.

## 0.2.0

* **Breaking:** BLE advertisements are filtered to IwayPlus beacons. Only
  advertisements whose advertised name starts with `IW` (case-insensitive)
  are relayed to the page; everything else is dropped in the scan callback on
  both Android and iOS.
* Consumers that relied on receiving every nearby advertiser no longer do.
  In particular a surrounding-device proximity report built from non-IW
  advertisers will now be empty.
* This saves CPU and bridge traffic, not radio power: Android's `ScanFilter`
  cannot match a name by prefix, so the radio still reports every advertiser
  and only the relay is skipped.
* Scanner cores stay in step with `iwayplus_scanner` 0.2.0.

## 0.1.1

* iOS BLE delivery fix.

## 0.1.0

* Initial release: native BLE, GPS and heading scanning on Android and iOS,
  relayed into the Iwayplus navigation page through `IwayplusNavigation`.
